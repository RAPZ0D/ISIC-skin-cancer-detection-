What is ISIC? 

The International Skin Imaging Collaboration, the ISIC Archive is a repository of dermatoscopic images that researchers and developers can use for training and evaluating algorithms for skin cancer detection. The dataset contains images of various skin lesions, including benign and malignant lesions. Each image is typically associated with metadata, such as diagnostic information and lesion characteristics.
This dataset is free and open source, researchers often use datasets like the ISIC Archive to train machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated skin cancer diagnosis. These models can assist dermatologists in early detection and classification of skin lesions.
