## ISIC DATASET 
What is ISIC? 
The International Skin Imaging Collaboration, the ISIC Archive is a repository of dermatoscopic images that researchers and developers can use for training and evaluating algorithms for skin cancer detection. The dataset contains images of various skin lesions, including benign and malignant lesions. Each image is typically associated with metadata, such as diagnostic information and lesion characteristics.
This dataset is free and open source, researchers often use datasets like the ISIC Archive to train machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated skin cancer diagnosis. These models can assist dermatologists in early detection and classification of skin lesions.

# Skin Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python Programming Language 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of deep learning models widely used for image analysis tasks like skin cancer detection. In Python, frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch provide efficient tools for building and training CNN models. CNNs automatically learn features from raw image data, making them well-suited for tasks where manual feature extraction is challenging. With their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and leverage transfer learning, CNNs offer a promising approach for accurate and reliable skin cancer detection.

## Introduction
I'm a data science and AI student who got excited about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While learning about CNNs, I found the ISIC website. It's a great place with lots of free data and challenges about skin problems. This got me thinking: why not use CNNs to help detect skin cancer?

I was inspired by all the resources on the ISIC website and decided to give it a try. My goal is simple: to use CNNs to tell if a skin lesion is harmful (malignant) or not (benign). This project is my way of learning more about CNNs and doing something meaningful at the same time. I wanted to make a simple but good model I hope to learn more about CNNs and also help fight skin cancer along the way.
